# Log Analysis Tool

## Overview

This Log Analysis Tool processes web server log data to extract useful insights, including:

1. **IP Requests**: Count the number of requests per IP address.
2. **Most Frequent Endpoint**: Identify the most accessed endpoint in the logs.
3. **Suspicious Activity**: Detect IP addresses with multiple failed login attempts (401 errors).

The tool can save the analysis results to a CSV file for easy sharing or further processing.

## Features

- **IP Requests**: Displays the number of requests made by each IP address in descending order.
- **Most Frequent Endpoint**: Shows the endpoint that received the highest number of accesses.
- **Suspicious Activity**: Detects IP addresses that made more than a specified number of failed login attempts (default threshold is 5). Results can be filtered based on this threshold.
- **CSV Export**: Allows saving all results (IP requests, most frequent endpoint, suspicious activity) to a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional dependencies required. The built-in `re`, `collections`, and `csv` modules are used.

## How to Use

1. **Run the script**:
   To run the log analysis tool, execute the Python script. The tool will prompt you for the log file path and present the following options:

   - **IP Requests**: View the IP addresses and their corresponding request counts.
   - **Most Frequent Endpoint**: See the most accessed endpoint and its access count.
   - **Suspicious Activity**: View IP addresses with failed login attempts exceeding the threshold.
   - **All Actions**: Perform all analyses (IP requests, most frequent endpoint, and suspicious activity).
   - **Save Results to CSV**: Save the results to a CSV file.
   - **Exit**: Exit the tool.

2. **CSV Export**:
   After selecting the "Save Results to CSV" option, the results will be saved to a file named `log_analysis_results.csv` (or another filename of your choice).
