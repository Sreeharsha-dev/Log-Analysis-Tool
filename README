# Log Analysis Tool üìä

## Overview üßë‚Äçüíª

Welcome to the **Log Analysis Tool**! This Python script helps you process and analyze web server log files to extract key insights, including:

- **IP Requests**: Count the number of requests made by each IP address.
- **Most Frequent Endpoint**: Identify the most frequently accessed endpoint in the logs.
- **Suspicious Activity**: Detect IP addresses with multiple failed login attempts (401 errors).

You can save the results in a CSV file for easy sharing or further analysis.

## Features üöÄ

- **IP Requests**: List the number of requests per IP address, sorted in descending order.
- **Most Frequent Endpoint**: Identify the endpoint that has received the most accesses.
- **Suspicious Activity**: Flag IP addresses that have more than a certain number of failed login attempts (default threshold: 5).
- **CSV Export**: Save the results to a CSV file, which includes IP requests, frequent endpoints, and suspicious activity.

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

- Python 3.x (compatible with Python 3.6+)
- No external dependencies required (uses built-in libraries: `re`, `collections`, `csv`)

   - **1. IP Requests**: View the number of requests made by each IP.
   - **2. Endpoints Analysis**: See which endpoint was accessed the most.
   - **3. Suspicious Activity**: View IPs with multiple failed login attempts (401 errors).
   - **4. All Actions**: Run all analyses (IP requests, most frequent endpoint, suspicious activity).
   - **5. Save Results to CSV**: Save the results in a CSV file.
   - **6. Exit**: Exit the tool.
